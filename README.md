**Vehicle-Classification**
  
   Image classification is a large field of research in computer vision and machine learning that aims to classify objects present in images into meaningful categories. In the context of intelligent traffic systems, object classifications of vehicles assumes a fundamental role and have a wide range of employment such as traffic surveillance, route optimization, and anomaly detection. Vehicle classification has been significantly important to vehicle census as it provides traffic count information to reflect the traffic density of a particular roadway. 
   
  In order to overcome these problems, an object detection technique is developed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN consists of many layers which is used to process the given input image and converts it into a grayscale image.

**Data augmentation**
  
   Initially pass the types of arguments and its values of datagenerator class and Then need to set the path of source of the dataset. For the given range of values, for the images present in the specified path data augmentation is performed.
   
**Conclusion**

Vehicle classification has been significantly important to vehicle census as it provides traffic count information to reflect the traffic density of a particular roadway. However, the trained model achieves poor performance on low resolution images captured from videos in the existing system.

The project proposes a vehicle type classification based on convolutional neural network. first collect large numbers of vehicle images from internet. Then select and build a new large no of vehicle classification dataset using data augmentation of two categories. train the dataset with CNN. Experimental results show that CNN achieve high accuracy on the validation dataset.

In future, the steps may be taken to improve accuracy and the CNN can be used to classify many vehicles of different categories. Further the CNN can also used to  identify the make and model of the vehicles which could help traffic monitoring system in various ways.
